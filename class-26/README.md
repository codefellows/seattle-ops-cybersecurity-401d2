# Remote Code Execution

## Overview

Throughout this class, you've developed shell scripts as a form of automation. What if this automation was weaponized and used against you? Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a software vulnerability that allows a threat actor to execute code on the target computer without normal (IAM-granted) authorization to do so. As a security practitioner you'll want to watch out for this and prepare to deal with it in field.
