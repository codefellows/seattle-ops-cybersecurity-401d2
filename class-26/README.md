# Threat Analysis with Cyber Kill Chain

## Overview

Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are intrusion campaigns launched by sophisticated adversaries that pose some of the biggest risks to the security of your network infrastructure. The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed to help cyber defenders better understand adversarial TTPs and therefore better take actions that will identify and prevent intrusions.
