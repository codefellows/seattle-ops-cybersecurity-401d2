# Interview 01

## Interview Question

 Ask the candidate: 
  - "What is a cybersecurity framework?"
    - What is an example of a cybersecurity framework?
  - "What is compliance?"
    - What compliance standards do cyber professionals commonly engage with? Name and define them to the best of your ability.
    - How can an organization achieve a specific compliance standard? 
      - Gap assessment
      - Implementation of required controls and processes
      - Explore how auditing relates to compliance.
      - What is a cybersecurity assessment and who performs it?

## Interviewer Notes

Key areas to explore and discuss:
- A **cybersecurity framework**  is a series of documents defining the best practices an organization follows to manage its cybersecurity risk.
  - Candidate should provide an example of a framework. The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a set of guidelines that private sector companies can follow to identify, detect, and respond to cyberattacks, including ways to prevent and recover from attacks. The five main functions of the CSF include:
    - Identify
    - Protect
    - Detect
    - Respond
    - Recover
- Generally, **compliance** is defined as conforming to rules and meeting requirements. 
- **Cyber compliance** is a more specific category of compliance. It involves creating a program that implements risk-mitigation  controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical IT systems and information.
- Various compliance standards exist to serve the needs of different sectors and industries. Candidate should name as many examples as possible:
  - HIPAA
  - PCI-DSS
  - GDPR
  - CCPA
  - NIST (many)
  - ISO (many)
  - SOC (many)
- Compliance is achieved through implementing the required controls and processes dictated by the compliance framework. 
- To verify compliance, **auditing** is performed. A third-party auditing team uses a ‘checklist’ that validates the policies a cybersecurity team stated are actually in place, and that there are control mechanisms in place to enforce them.
- Alternatively, a **cybersecurity assessment** can be performed by an internal team and is generally less formal of a process than hiring an external auditor.

## Preparation

Before the interview:
- Carefully review the interview question and interviewer notes.
- Create your own copy of [Whiteboard Ops Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit#gid=1422288328){:target="_blank"}
- Fill in the details at the top, such as Student and Interviewer
- Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview. Review the criteria in advance of the interview so you can steer the conversation towards the scoring requirements.

## During the Interview

- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate the interview question(s)
- Score the candidate according to the rubric
  - Assign points for each item on the rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate
- Every solution might look and sound a little different, but the candidate should be able to verify their solution with different edge cases to verify correctness. The candidate should NOT be reading notes verbatim; instead, quesitions should be answered as authentically as possible.

## After the interview

- Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. Include a photo or screenshot of their whiteboard.
- Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.
