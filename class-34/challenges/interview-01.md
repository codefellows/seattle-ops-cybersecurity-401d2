# Interview 01

## Interview Question

First, notify the candidate that today's technical interview will be referencing this file on their FLARE VM: C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\class-33-pestudio\ghidra_blog_binaries-master\ghidra_blog_post_1\Overlong.exe. Give the candidate some time to verify access to this file, as this will be a part of the technical interview today.

When the candidate is ready, ask the candidate the following questions one at a time:

- Can you help me determine if this software is safe for me to install on my work PC? Show me how you would go about this process.
- What specific indicators led you to your conclusion?
- If you had more time, what steps would you take to analyze this software at a deeper level?
- What are some best practices for my employees to avoid malware-ridden downloads?

## Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate the interview question(s)
- Score the candidate according to the [Whiteboard Ops Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit#gid=1422288328){:target="_blank"}
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate

## Structure

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to verify their solution with different edge cases to verify correctness.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. Include a photo or screenshot of their whiteboard.
