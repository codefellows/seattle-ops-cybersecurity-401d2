## Interviewer Notes



## Preparation

Before the interview:
- Carefully review the interview question and interviewer notes.
- Create your own copy of [Whiteboard Ops Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit#gid=1422288328){:target="_blank"}
- Fill in the details at the top, such as Student and Interviewer
- Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview. Review the criteria in advance of the interview so you can steer the conversation towards the scoring requirements.

## During the Interview

- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate the interview question(s)
- Score the candidate according to the rubric
  - Assign points for each item on the rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate
- Every solution might look and sound a little different, but the candidate should be able to verify their solution with different edge cases to verify correctness. The candidate should NOT be reading notes verbatim; instead, quesitions should be answered as authentically as possible.

## After the interview

- Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. Include a photo or screenshot of their whiteboard.
- Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.
