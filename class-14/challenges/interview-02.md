# Interview 02

Ask the candidate: "Do you prefer filtered ports or closed ports on your firewall?"

- How can ports be scanned?
- If I move my well-known port to a random port number, am I secure against attack? Why?
- What is the difference between a packet filtered/dropped versus no response in an ICMP echo request?
- What are some alternatives to NMAP?

## Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Act as an interviewer during a technical interview.
- Score the candidate according to the [Whiteboard Ops Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw/edit#gid=1422288328){:target="_blank"}
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don't solve it for the candidate

## Structure

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to verify their solution with different edge cases to verify correctness.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. Include a photo or screenshot of their whiteboard.

## Documentation

Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.
