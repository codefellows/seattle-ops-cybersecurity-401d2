# Ops 401

## Course Overview

Ready to kickstart your exciting career in cyber ops? In this intensive course, delve into critical cyber processes like risk assessment, data encryption, network security, threat modeling, code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and incident response. Gain valuable ethical hacker skills in penetration testing, and show off your awesome new abilities in two resume-enhancing projects!

Designed to prepare you for todayâ€™s most in-demand security skills, this hands-on course emphasizes practical cyber operations including both offensive and defensive roles. Students will gain cutting-edge cyber ops skills by analyzing and exploiting systems vulnerabilities, implementing defenses against common threats, and using cyber toolkits such as Kali Linux and Metasploit. Vulnerability scanning tools such as Nessus are utilized, as well as security monitoring tools such as Splunk.

This course includes a career coaching curriculum to get you ready for your job search, plus job search assistance after graduation. The course totals 400 hours, including lectures, lab, coworking, and collaborative projects.

### The first half of the course is made up of 4 modules focusing on: 

- Module 1 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Module 2 Data Security
- Module 3 Security Operations 1
- Module 4 Cloud Security
- Module 5 Midterm Project

### The second half of the course is comprised of 4 modules focusing on:

- Module 6 Threat Modeling and Analysis
- Module 7 Security Operations 2
- Module 8 AppSec and Vulnerability Analysis
- Module 9 Penetration Testing
- Module 10 Final Project

## Downloads Overview

All required downloads of large files will be listed here to help you prepare for each class lab activity. It is your responsibility to:
- Maintain a reliable high speed internet connection.
- Maintain adequate hard drive space on your lab kit PC.
- Download the required files in a timely fashion, preferably well in advance of the class you'll be using it. 

If you encounter issues downloading the required files for a class, troubleshoot the issue with your instructor outside of lecture. Your instructor will be responsible for maintaining working download links.

To avoid lengthy software installation and setup times, many of the required virtual machines used in this course have been prepared for you in advance. Unlike Ops 301, required infrastructure will commonly be provided to you by way of OVA files, unless the installation and setup of the infrastructure is a part of the learning objectives for the day.

It is generally a good idea to maintain a "core lab" in VirtualBox representing the key elements of a cyber range throughout the course and even past graduation:
- PfSense Router/Firewall
- Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller
- Windows 10 Endpoint (Domained)
- Ubuntu Server 20.10 Web Server
- Ubuntu Server 20.10 GitHub Repository Development Box
- Ubuntu Desktop 20.10 Threat Hunter/IDS Machine
- Kali Linux Attacker Box

Several labs and projects in Ops 401 require an AWS account and free tier hours to avoid incurring charges. It will be your responsibility to maintain and shut down cloud machines in a timely fashion to avoid incurring charges on AWS. Note that creating instances in EC2 involves the use of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) and not OVAs.

Files customized for this course are intended for students and should not be shared/distributed beyond this class.

## Downloads Table

Files are either hosted externally by the source (for example, kali.org hosts Kali Linux ISO) or hosted by Code Fellows using iCloud (Mirror 1) or Google Drive (Mirror 2). You may be prompted to create a free user account for the corresponding service in order to download the hosted files.

Note that "Mirror 2" is an alternative source for downloading the same file. Use the Mirror 2 download link if the primary download link, Mirror 1, does not work. You do not need to download both the Mirror 1 and Mirror 2 for a given class; they are the same file. If none of the provided download links work, contact your instructor for assistance.

Occasionally an OS installer ISO is listed for the class, which indicates that the listed OS is required for the lab. For ISO files, you do not need to download more than one copy to a local computer. Many of these you likely already have saved locally if you completed previous prerequisite coursework with Code Fellows.
