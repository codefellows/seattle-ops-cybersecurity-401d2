## Structure

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to verify their solution with different edge cases to verify correctness.

Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page. Include a photo or screenshot of their whiteboard.
