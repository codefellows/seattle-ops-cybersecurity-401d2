# Threat Analysis with MITRE ATT&CK

## Overview

Threat analysis involves the assessment of adversaries, TTPs, and APTs to better understand threats and therefore mitigate them appropriately. As defenders, we want to ideally simulate a known TTP and then assess how we can best detect and prevent them in our environments. Modern security teams have access to MITRE ATT&CK, a community database of known TTPs. We also have access to Red Canary's Atomic Red Team, an open source library created to test TTPs mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, providing a hands-on method to test how systems respond to specific MITRE ATT&CK TTPs. Cyber defenders must become students of MITRE ATT&CK and be able to test their defenses using the Atomic Red Team project.
