# Strategic Policy Development

In striving to mitigate cyber risk for an organization, it is vital to structure such efforts in accordance with industry best practice. One such practice is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, or CSF. Developed by NIST in response to Executive Order 13636 issue in February 2013, the CSF sets benchmarks for an organization to mature its security process towards, with the ultimate aim of reducing cyber risks to mission-critical infrastructure.
